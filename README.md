Labs 5 through 8 provide a bridge between the first and second half of CPEN 211. Starting with this lab
and continuing in the next three you will build a computer that implements a “Reduced Instruction Set
Computer” (RISC). The chips that power iPhone and Android smartphones also include a computer using a
RISC “instruction set architecture” (ISA) known as ARM. By completing this series of labs you will have
key insights into how those chips work. Labs 5 through 8 develop foundational knowledge you will use
when we learn how to program ARM chips in “assembly” code
