# Simple-RISC-Machine
The “Simple RISC Machine” executes programs written using a very small set of “instructions”. The chips that power iPhone and Android smartphones also include a computer using a
RISC “instruction set architecture” (ISA) known as ARM. By completing this project we got key insights into how those chips work.
