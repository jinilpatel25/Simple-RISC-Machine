In this lab I build a computer that implements a “Reduced Instruction Set
Computer” (RISC). The chips that power iPhone and Android smartphones also include a computer using a
RISC “instruction set architecture” (ISA) known as ARM. By completing this series of labs I acquired
key insights into how those chips work.This lab build foundational knowledge that I used
to learn how to program ARM chips in “assembly” code
